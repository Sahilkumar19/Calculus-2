# Calculus-2
This is my first repository.In this repo will add various algorithms of calculus part 2 of my btech course.
I will add python implementation of the algorithms.


In this Repo you will find the following:

1.Python implementation of different kinds of damping like what are the condition for  
overdamping, critical and under damping and their graphs.

2.A complete tutorial on linear regression

3.First and second order differential equations and how to solve them and their python implementation.
